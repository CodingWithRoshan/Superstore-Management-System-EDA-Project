# Superstore Management System – EDA Project 📊

The **Superstore Management System – EDA Project** is a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** based analytics project designed to understand and optimize retail business operations.  
This project aims to generate insights into **sales performance, profit trends, customer behavior, product demand, supplier activity, inventory movement, and delivery performance** using Python and Power BI dashboards.

## 📌 Project Title
**Superstore Management System – EDA Project**

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to convert raw retail transactional data into **meaningful and actionable business insights** through:

- Synthetic dataset generation  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizations and reporting  
- Interactive dashboards using Power BI  

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Retail superstores generate large volumes of data daily such as:
- Sales transactions
- Customer details
- Product information
- Pricing and discounts
- Inventory and stock levels
- Supplier details
- Delivery status and payment methods

But many businesses fail to extract meaningful insights due to lack of proper analytics systems.  
This project solves that problem by building a structured **EDA pipeline** and **BI dashboards** to support better decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Synthetic dataset generation using **Faker library**  
✅ Data preprocessing (missing values, duplicates, datatype conversion)  
✅ Feature engineering (Month, Year, Profit Margin)  
✅ Univariate analysis  
✅ Bivariate and correlation analysis  
✅ Time-series trend analysis  
✅ Power BI interactive dashboards:
- Sales Performance Dashboard  
- Inventory & Supplier Dashboard  
- Customer & Delivery Insights Dashboard

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
### Python Libraries
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Faker
- Random, Datetime

### Tools
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Power BI Desktop
- CSV File Format

## 📌 Dataset Information
This project **does not use any common/public dataset** (like Kaggle, UCI, etc.).

✅ The dataset is **fully self-generated** using the **Python Faker library**, along with random functions, to create realistic Superstore data such as:
- Orders
- Customers
- Products
- Categories
- Pricing & Discounts
- Inventory & Stock
- Suppliers
- Delivery Status
- Payment Modes

This makes the project **unique and original**, and helps in simulating real-world retail business scenarios.

## 📊 Dataset Columns
The dataset contains **1000+ records** with important columns such as:

- Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date  
- Customer ID, Customer Name, Customer Segment  
- Product ID, Product Name, Category  
- Region, State, City  
- Quantity, Unit Price, Discount (%)  
- Sale Amount, Cost Price, Profit  
- Payment Mode, Delivery Status  
- Stock Left, Auto Reorder, Reorder Quantity  
- Supplier Name, Supplier Email  
- Order Month, Order Year, Profit Margin
